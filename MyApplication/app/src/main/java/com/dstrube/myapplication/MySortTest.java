         * Bubble sort, also referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that works by
         * repeatedly stepping through the list to be sorted, comparing each pair of adjacent items and
         * swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps
         * are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted. The algorithm gets its name from the way
         * smaller elements "bubble" to the top of the list. Because it only uses comparisons to operate on
         * elements, it is a comparison sort. Although the algorithm is simple, most of the other sorting
         * algorithms are more efficient for large lists.
         *
         * Bubble sort has worst-case and average complexity both О(n^2), where n is the number of items being
         * sorted. There exist many sorting algorithms with substantially better worst-case or average
         * complexity of O(n log n). Even other О(n^2) sorting algorithms, such as insertion sort, tend to have
         * better performance than bubble sort. Therefore, bubble sort is not a practical sorting algorithm
         * when n is large. Performance of bubble sort over an already-sorted list (best-case) is O(n).

         * Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm, it builds the final sorted array one item at a time.
         * It is much less efficient on large lists than other sort algorithms.
         *
         * Advantages of Insertion Sort:
         *
         * 1) It is very simple.
         * 2) It is very efficient for small data sets.
         * 3) It is stable; i.e., it does not change the relative order of elements with equal keys.
         * 4) In-place; i.e., only requires a constant amount O(1) of additional memory space.
         *
         * Insertion sort iterates through the list by consuming one input element at each repetition, and
         * growing a sorted output list. On a repetition, insertion sort removes one element from the input
         * data, finds the location it belongs within the sorted list, and inserts it there. It repeats until
         * no input elements remain.
         *
         * The best case input is an array that is already sorted. In this case insertion sort has a linear
         * running time (i.e., Θ(n)). During each iteration, the first remaining element of the input is only
         * compared with the right-most element of the sorted subsection of the array. The simplest worst
         * case input is an array sorted in reverse order. The set of all worst case inputs consists of all
         * arrays where each element is the smallest or second-smallest of the elements before it. In these
         * cases every iteration of the inner loop will scan and shift the entire sorted subsection of the
         * array before inserting the next element. This gives insertion sort a quadratic running time
         * (i.e., O(n2)). The average case is also quadratic, which makes insertion sort impractical for
         * sorting large arrays. However, insertion sort is one of the fastest algorithms for sorting very
         * small arrays, even faster than quicksort; indeed, good quicksort implementations use insertion
         * sort for arrays smaller than a certain threshold, also when arising as subproblems; the exact
         * threshold must be determined experimentally and depends on the machine, but is commonly around ten.
